## Resources

- [Responsive Navigation](http://responsive-nav.com/)

    - I used this JQuery plugin to build my responsive navigation bar. It offers a clickable "menu" link when displayed on a smaller screen, and a larger full sceen navigation when on larger screens.


- [Skills Bar](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/NbdQJJ)

    - I used this site to use JQuery to show my skills in an animated bar graph. I was able to include the skills I wished, and the appropriate skill level.


- [Smooth Scroll](http://www.dwuser.com/education/content/quick-guide-adding-smooth-scrolling-to-your-webpages/)

    - I think every site should incorporate a smooth scroll, and this JQuery plugin added that to my site.
    

- [Color Combos](http://www.colorcombos.com/color-schemes/119/ColorCombo119.html)

    - This site simply helped me pick out my color scheme for my resume.

### Deductions
- I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#### Comments
- I tried to use a theme similar to that of my overall personal website for my resume page, because my intention is to incorporate them together. You may notice that the color scheme is slightly different. On my personal webpage, the colors are broken up with background images. On this site, I did not incorporate images into the background so I felt it needed more variation in the color scheme.
